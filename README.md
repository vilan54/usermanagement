# Spring User Management

## Understanding the Spring User Management
The goal of this project is to simplify future development by having the user management aspect covered.
Users will be divided into roles, and each role will have its own permissions. There will be a fixed 'ADMIN' role that can create users, roles, and assign permissions to them.
In addition, we will have a frontend section that will show us a login/registration form and the permissions for each authenticated user.
